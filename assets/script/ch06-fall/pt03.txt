Cap’n Cutout:
Thank yeh kindly! We’ll be shipping these out immediately!

Alma:
Oh, and []? Would you mind adding in these Thanksgiving cards, too?

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
That actually reminds me of a story!

Cap’n Cutout:
One day, Alma and I went over to my parents’ house with the kids…

Alma [questioning]:
Oh no, not this story!

Cap’n Cutout:
And we just got so stuffed with turkey that we were all so tired. Alma got up to put a dish away…

Cap’n Cutout [sad]:
And she was gone for such a long time I started to worry about her.

Cap’n Cutout:
So I go to the kitchen to see what’s wrong…

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
And she’s just standing there, plate in hand, completely asleep!

Alma [questioning]:
I’ve never fallen asleep standing up before! It was humiliating!

Cap’n Cutout:
Well, I thought it was cute.

Alma:
That your wife shares the same skills as a horse?

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
Horses can sleep standing up? Well, I think that’s pretty cute, too.

Alma [laughing]:
Oh, Captain....
