Cap’n Cutout:
All right! It was kind of a dry spell there lately, but now that it’s entering the holiday season, we’re going to be having a lot more orders. So get ready!

Cap’n Cutout:
First, we have some requests for some anniversary cards. I’ll put them on your desk.

Cap’n Cutout:
Ahhh, I remember when Alma and I first met… it was around the fall like this, too.

Cap’n Cutout:
We worked together at a bubblegum research lab. She was the elasticity tester, and I was the package design…

Cap’n Cutout [sad]:
She kept shooting looks over at me, and I thought she was angry with me.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
So I walked up to her and I asked her, “Do you have a problem with me?!”

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
She kissed me on the nose! Can you believe that?

Cap’n Cutout:
One night, when no one was at the factory, we snuck in and…

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
STOLE THE BUBBLEGUM RIGHT OUT OF THE BUBBLEGUM MAKER!

Cap’n Cutout:
Oooh, I can’t believe she made me do that! It was so secretive, so naughty…

Cap’n Cutout [questioning:
Errr… anyways…
