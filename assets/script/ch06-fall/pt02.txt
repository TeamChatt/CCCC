Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
Oh! I almost forgot these—we’re supposed to send out these Halloween cards and I plumb near fergot!

Cap’n Cutout: Because we’re working on a tight deadline, these cards have a timer in the upper right hand corner.

Cap’n Cutout:
When the timer reaches zero, that’s it! So make sure you complete all the cards within the time.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
On yer mark, get set…GO!
