Alma [laughing]:
Thank you so much.

Alma [questioning]:
And…you know…don’t tell people about the sleeping standing up thing, okay?

Cap’n Cutout [sad]:
Hey [], I was wonderin’… I haven’t seen mail from your friend lately. Are they doin’ okay?

Alma: I’m sure [she’s/he’s/they’re] just fine…right? [She’s/He’s/They’re] probably busy. Better just send [her/him/them] a card just to remind them. Oh and…would you mind adding something else to your stack? It’s a card project for the holidays.
