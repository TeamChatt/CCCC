Alma:
Thanks for all your hard work! The Captain’s out with the kids doing an egg hunt today.

Alma:
I was going to go with them, but the kiddos clung to his arms and kept crying, “But we want Daddy to be the Easter Bunny!”

Alma [laughing]:
You should have seen the Captain’s face! He was so embarrassed. He loves them to pieces, you know.

Alma:
It’s okay, though, it gives me time to run the shop. Afterwards I even have time to do my favorite hobby…

Alma:
Weightlifting!

Alma [laughing]:
What, you don’t think a gal like me can lift? I’ll have you know I placed first in the county competition!

Alma [questioning]:
Oops! I almost forgot. I have mail for you.

Alma [questioning]:
Tell me… who do you suppose your admirer is?
