Cap’n Cutout:
Just a normal sentence. Totally normal. Nothing weird about what I'm saying at all.

Alma:
Yep. It’s all serious business. This is my serious face.

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
How come you’re being all serious?

Alma [sad]:
I’m sad now for some reason. Look at my sad face.

Alma [questioning]:
But I don’t know why I’m sad. So now I’m questioning it.

Cap’n Cutout [sad]:
Now I’m sad too. This is my face when I’m sad.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
Now I’m being silly. Check out how zany I’m being.

Alma [laughing]:
Hahaha! You’re so funny, Captain.
