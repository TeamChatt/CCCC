Alma [sad]:
It’s been a week and still no mail…

CC:
Well, we can’t be sitting around and being mopey, can we?

Alma [questioning]:
Like when Ryan started pouting that we hadn’t gotten him that...what was it again?

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
Goat Simulator 3000?

Alma [questioning]:
I kept asking him, “Honey, why would you want to be a goat in a video game when you could just be a little boy?”

Alma:
He just told me I wouldn’t get it because I was an adult. I guess that’s the cross I have to bear now.

Cap’n Cutout:
I just told him goat puns until he got mad and said, “Maya, let’s go into our rooms away from the -adults.-”

Alma [questioning]:
I kinda feel like a bad parent.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
No way! You’re the best mom that ever mommed.

Alma:
Well, Ryan did end up buying it with his allowance… I’m glad he finally got it.

Cap’n Cutout:
And with his own money, no doubt!

Alma:
Speaking of Christmas, [], cut out these Christmas cards if you wouldn’t mind.
