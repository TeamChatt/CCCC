Cap’n Cutout:
Welcome to your first day at Cap’n Cutout’s Card Creations! I’m Cap’n Cutout, and I’ll be your boss fer your time here.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
…but don’t think of it like I’m yer boss! We’re partners in yarrrrms!

Cap’n Cutout:
I started this small carrrd shop here when me wife and I spent two years aparrrrt.

We sent each other handmade cards every week, and when we met again, we decided we wanted to spread the love to other folks!

That’s why yer here: we’ve grown past the point where she and I can make our carrds; we need some help!

Alma:
Honey, would you mind picking the kids up from school?

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
Well blow me down—errr, can I borrow the keys to the minivan?

Alma [laughing]:
*chuckles* Sure, Captain.

Cap’n Cutout:
First though, the tax guy’s gonna have me head if I don’t have you fill out this paperwork. Alma will show you the ropes while I go get the little landlubbers.
