Whew, the summer’s hot, isn’t it? How’s your work going?

Cap’n Cutout:
After a long day of work, I just like to kick back with a nice…cold…

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
Popsicle!

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
The other day, I was about to settle back in my chair with a beer, but my youngest daughter, Maya stuck a popsicle in the beer.

Cap’n Cutout:
She said, “This is to make sure your drink is cold, daddy!”

Cap’n Cutout [sad]:
That was so sweet of her, but my beer…

Cap’n Cutout:
I ended up thanking her and eating a beer-soaked popsicle. And you know, it wasn’t half-bad!

Cap’n Cutout:
The things you learn…

Cap’n Cutout:
Anyway, looks like yer receiving a lot more love notes lately, eh? I got a response for you.

Cap’n Cutout [silly]:
Don’t read them all at once!
