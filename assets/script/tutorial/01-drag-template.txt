Alma:
Great let’s continue.

The desk you’re looking at right now is your workspace. It’s where you’ll do all of your card cutting.

When we get an order in, we’ll tell you and give you a stack of card templates. A card template looks something like this.

Your stack of card templates are on the lower right hand side of the screen. When you begin a project, pull a card template off the stack by [clicking/tapping] and dragging it to your workspace. Try it!
