Cap’n Cutout:
Hah! Looks like someone else appreciates your taste, too. Ain’t that a great feeling?

Alma:
You know, I seem to remember a younger Captain who had a penchant for making very terrible nautical puns…

Cap’n Cutout:
Errrm, I have no idea what yer talking about, Alma! Ehehehe…

Alma [laughing]:
I was the first person who laughed at his puns. I still think they’re charming.

Cap’n Cutout [questioning]:
Yer makin’ me blush!

Alma:
Well, what are you waiting for? Write {her/him/them} a card back!
