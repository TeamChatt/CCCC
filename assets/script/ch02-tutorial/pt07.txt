Alma [laughing]:
Thank you so much. You’re already off to a great start.

Cap’n Cutout:
How [is she/is he/are they] doing?

Alma:
Just fine, darling!

Alma:
One last thing...when we don’t have orders coming in, you can make card designs of your own to sell in our shop. When you have downtime, you’ll have some blank sheets of cardstock in the lower-left hand corner. Drag a blank sheet from the stack to get started!
